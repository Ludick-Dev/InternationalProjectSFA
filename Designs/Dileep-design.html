              Welcome to Sign For All, the cutting-edge sign language to text
              conversion tool developed in collaboration with Fontys and PXL.
              Our goal is to make communication more accessible and inclusive
              for people who use sign language as their primary means of
              communication.

        <p>
          Our program uses advanced artificial intelligence and computer vision
          techniques to interpret and translate sign language gestures into
          written text in real-time. This means that our tool can help bridge
          the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign
          language users, enabling them to communicate more easily and
          effectively. Sign For All is easy to use and can be accessed through a
          variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.

        <p class="aText">
          <b>Mission:</b> To supply the industry with highly qualified and
          experienced Information Technology personnel by providing
          high-quality, practice-orientated education and training of an
          International standard. We know this will contribute to economic
          growth and wealth creation. <br />
          <br />

          Belgium Campus iTversity is at the forefront of what a modern
          university should be. By investing in people, attracting investors,
          running community programmes and engaging with local communities and
          authorities, we ensure that this sentiment is adhered to. We conduct
          our operations in the spirit of ubuntu – for the benefit of all.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Vision:</b> To transform South Africa into a prosperous nation.
          There is a great demand for highly skilled graduates with the right
          competencies, and higher education has a big role to play in this
          development process. We realise we have to do things differently from
          other universities. The strategy of a university should and must make
          a significant impact on regional development by cooperating with
          industry and business and by educating and delivering the required
          workforce on all levels.

        <h2>Fontys University of Applied Sciences</h2>
        <p class="aText">
          Development is a key concept at Fontys. Young people develop their
          talents as students with us, we develop relevant practical knowledge,
          working professionals can also develop further at Fontys, we respond
          flexibly to far-reaching social developments and – last but not least
          – within our community we develop ourselves by sharing knowledge and
          skills. <br />
          <br />

          We operate in the heart of society. In our hybrid learning and
          research environments, students, lecturers, researchers, and
          professionals work together. In that way, education and research, as
          well as learning and working, become increasingly intertwined. Our
          main social value is therefore the development of talent and
          knowledge. <br />
          <br />

          Fontys is a multidisciplinary university of applied sciences in the
          south of the Netherlands. Together with and for the (regional)
          professional environments, we provide high-quality, higher vocational
          education and conduct innovative, practice-oriented research. In this
          way, we contribute to the development of a dynamic, inclusive, and
          sustainable society. <br />

        <h2>PXL University of Applied Sciences and Arts</h2>
        <p class="aText">
          <b>Mission:</b> PXL University of Applied Sciences professionalizes
          people and organizations and thus contributes to prosperity and
          well-being. <br />
          <br />
          <b>Vision:</b>Through a strong intertwining of education, research,
          services and the practice of the arts, PXL University of Applied
          Sciences wants its students (junior colleagues) and employees to grow
          further as excellent professionals (= X-factor) and, together with its
          partners, to grow as an excellent professional organization (=
          X-factor). We translate the PXL vision into the X-factor that is a
          model for the 'excellent professional' and for the 'excellent
          professional organization'. We always use 'excellent' in combination
          (-) with 'professional' because we do not strive for excellence per
          se, but for 'excellent professional'. The X-factor is a combination of
          (em)passion, of being enterprising and innovative, of
          (multi)disciplinarity and of (international) collaboration (network)
          working. The X-factor with its 4 overlapping axes, forms a single and
          indivisible whole of hard and soft skills and is more than the sum of
          its parts. The X-factor has a double effect. It is both our
          'look-pointer' and our 'compass'. The look-pointer for
          (self)reflection indicates where we stand at the start, the compass
          shows us the way to the ultimate goal, the excellent professional /
          professional organization. The X-factor is not only a look-pointer and
          a compass for our junior colleagues, our staff and network, but also
          for PXL University of Applied Sciences, as a beacon in its pursuit of
          an excellent professional organization (= X-factor)
